## Requirements

### Back-end

Python 3.6+

Dependencies are specified in `requirements.txt`

```zsh
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Install dependencies
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Front-end

1. PHP 7.2+ (older versions may work)
1. [PHP Zip](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18774568/installing-php-zip-extension)
1. Any Webserver

## Installation
All of the configuration parameters you must change for the site to work are located in `./front_end/config/required.php`
Optional parameters are located in `./front_end/config/optional.php`

1. Open the `./front_end/config/required.php` file. Change the logic to properly detect correct `CONFIGURATION` and `DEVELOPMENT` constant values. The value of `DEVELOPMENT` will affect the error reporting level.
1. Set `LINK` to an address the website would be served on.
1. Set `WORKING_LOCATION` to an empty folder. This would be the destination for all the files created in the process. Make sure the webserver and the user that would execute `back_end/refresh_data.py` has **READ** and **WRITE** permissions to this folder. **Warning!** Files present in this directory may be deleted.
1. Run `back_end/refresh_data.py`. This will automatically check for new versions of the taxa tree and download it. **You should also setup a daily or monthly CRON job for this file to keep your data up to date**
1. Configure your webserver to point to `front_end` directory.


### Optional settings
You can go over the other settings in the `./front_end/config/optional.php` file and see if there is anything you would like to adjust.

For example:
1. You can configure stats reporting by making `STATS_URL` point to a location of `collect/` script from [Taxa Tree Stats reporter](https://github.com/specify/taxa_tree_stats)
